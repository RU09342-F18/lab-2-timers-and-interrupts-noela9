The functio of this code is that the LED will start blinking at a slow rate, but when the button is held and released, the LED should blink at the speed of how long it was held. If the button is touched, the LED should blink at a very fast rate. This was done by combining both the button interrupt idea and the timer interrupt idea into one code. The functionality of the timer interrupt is to toggle the LED, while the functionality of the port vector is to count the time of the LED being held. When the button is held, the timer is set to continuous mode, which allows the timer to count up to the maximum value (0xFFFF) and reset. Then when the button is not being held, it is sent back to up mode which allows the timer to count up to the previous value of the timer, which allows it to hold the same frequency. The interrupt edge select (P1IES) is what figures out if the button is pressed or not. If the bit is 0, then the button is at a rising edge, and if the bit is 1, then the button is at a falling edge. At the end of the interrupt, the flag is cleared.
