With this lab, a timer interrupt was used to blink the LED. The interrupt was set to toggle the LED. Similar to all of the other codes written in this lab, the watch dog timer is initially stopped. Then P1 is set in the output direction. Next, the compare capture register interrupt is enableld and the input timer is set to A clock (32 KHz) and is in UP mode with a divider of 1/4. The compare capture register is then set to 40000. There is an empty while loop to keep the progran running. This program works by continuously running through the interrupt every clock cycle. The CCR counts up to 40000, then restarts and continues the process. The only difference betwee the coding for the 2553 and the 2311 are that the 2311 microcontroller has to use Timer B, and the requires an extra line of code to remove itself from low power mode.
