The function of this code is the same as the function of the button blink portion from lab 1. When the button is pressed, the LED should blink and when not pressed, the LED should remain at its last state. This was done using a port interrupt. Pin 1.0 is first set to the output direction and bit 0 of P1OUT is set to 0, which means that the LED will not be illuminated. Next, the interrupt enable is set to be equal to itself OR'ed with BIT3 or the button input. When the button is pushed, the interupt is enabled and when not pushed it is disabled. The interrupt is used to toggle the LED anda also clear the flag of the button. Clearing the flag means to tell the computer that there is no interrupt pending. Similar code is used for the 2311 except that the input for the button is Pin 1.1 instead of pin 1.3.
